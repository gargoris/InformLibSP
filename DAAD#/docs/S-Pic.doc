   
Self-Displaying ILBM

   The most notable fact about pictures - whether ILBM format or any other -
 is that they take up a terrible lot of space.  Which means that to save
 space they are normally compressed.  Which in turn means that either a
 compatible display program must be available, or the picture file must be
 decompressed before use.   The advantage of self-displaying compressed
 ILBMs which need no separate external displayer or decompression program
 will be obvious.  

   There are one or two programs around which will produce self-displaying
 pics, but so far as I am aware, none that incorporate compression.


Hence S-Pic

   S-Pic will handle IFF ILBM of all types up to overscan HIRES/LACE in size.
 Some of the new System3 display modes may also work.  Cycling is not supported
 in this version.  
 
   S-Pic first adds a display header (approx 800 bytes).  Then it checks
 whether the ILBM is compressed (P-Compress format), if not the file is
 compressed - a check is made as to whether the gain is greater than the
 size of the decompression header - if not the uncompressed version is used.
 Decompression header is added where it is needed.

   Small pictures such as brushes under about 2K will not be compressed and
 will end up some 800 bytes larger.  Larger files will be compressed and 
 will normally be smaller than the original in spite of the added headers.

   Advantages over a simple compressed pic + decompressing display tool include:

   Disk space:   Apart from P-Reader (P-Compress format) the only programs
       that will display compressed ILBMs work with Power Packer files.
       This is not a very efficient compressor and S-Pics, even with the
       included headers will normally be smaller than the same pic compressed
       with PowerPacker - and much smaller than the Power Packed pic + display
       tool.

    Convenience:  No fiddling around with icon Default Tools.
   
    Portability:   The pic can be transferred anywhere without worrying over
       whether a suitable decompressor/display tool is available, or changing
       icons.

    Speed: At a CLI it is a lot quicker to type "Art-Gallery" than for
       example "dh0:c/PPShow Art-Gallery" 

   As with S-Texts the real point is that it gives you a file that can be
  moved from disk to disk without having to even consider whether suitable
  decompressing displayers are on them, and can distribute without having to
  consider whether recipients have any means of decompressing and displaying.

   S-Pic is one of a family of tools for the production of self-executing
  files.  S-Text has already been released.  S-Anim and S-Exec will follow
  in due course.

 
                          INSTRUCTIONS

   Very very simple:

   To create the executable pic open a CLI and type:

                 S-Pic <picfile> <outfile>

   The <outfile> must be different from <picfile>, you cannot directly
  replace pics with their executable offspring.  It is a good idea to add
  an extension (.se) to the outfile to distinguish it from a primitive
  non-executable pic.
 
   For Workbench use provide the executable with a TOOL type icon.

   To view the pic treat the file just like any other executable:

     At a CLI type the name, use RUN if you wish.
     From Workbench double-click the icon.

    To quit press the LEFT mouse button.
