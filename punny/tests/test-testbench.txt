tried out. Don't expect much of a game here. Currently, you can win by putting
stuff in the box, or lose by checking out the sun by the river or by pushing

Testbench

Huge library
You are in an old and deserted library. There is an exit leading south and a
toilet to the east.

There's a black dial on the wall.

A blue book is standing on a shelf. Looking at the blue book makes you dizzy.

An old and torn green book is here.

You can also see a light switch, a sweater, an aquarium (which is open but
empty), a box (which is closed), a shelf (on which are a pair of boots), a
ladder (on which is a sticker), John, an infinite bag (which is open but empty),
that stupid old pink book and an electric torch (Ugly as sin) here.
