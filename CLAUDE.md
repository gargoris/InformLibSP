# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

InformLibSP is a Spanish language extension library for Inform 6 interactive fiction development that integrates with Inform's standard language flag system. **This library works alongside the standard Inform library** using the `+language_name=spanish` compilation flag, providing comprehensive Spanish language support including parsing, verbs, and grammar.

## Build and Development Commands

### Compiling Games
```bash
# Using Linux Inform 6 compiler with Spanish language support
./inform6_linux/Inform6/inform +language_name=spanish -S gameFile.inf

# Using Windows compiler (if available)
inform6.exe +language_name=spanish -S gameFile.inf

# Playing compiled games
./Frotz.exe gameFile.z5  # or .z8
```

### Testing
```bash
# Canonical example - main reference implementation
./inform6_linux/Inform6/inform +language_name=spanish -S Otros/ejemplos/rioja.inf

# Additional test examples (may be removed in future)
./inform6_linux/Inform6/inform +language_name=spanish -S Otros/ejemplos/tests/test_simple.inf
./inform6_linux/Inform6/inform +language_name=spanish -S Otros/ejemplos/tests/test_spanishlib.inf
```

## Architecture

### Standard Language Flag Integration
**IMPORTANT**: This library integrates with Inform's standard language system. Games using this library should:

- **ALWAYS include Parser.h and VerbLib.h** - standard Inform libraries
- **DO NOT manually include Spanish.h** - loaded automatically via language flag
- Use the `+language_name=spanish` compilation flag
- Use Spanish vocabulary and verb forms throughout

### Standard Game Setup (CORRECT PATTERN)
```inform6
! Character encoding setup (for accented characters)
Zcharacter table + '@{E1}' '@{E9}' '@{ED}' '@{F3}' '@{FA}' '@{FC}' '@{F1}' 
               '@{C1}' '@{C9}' '@{CD}' '@{D3}' '@{DA}' '@{DC}' '@{D1}'
               '@{BF}' '@{A1}';

! Configure features (optional) - BEFORE including standard libraries
Constant SPANISH_META_COMMANDS;
Constant SPANISH_IRREGULAR_VERBS;
! Note: SPANISH_FULL_MESSAGES temporarily disabled due to compilation issues

! Standard Inform includes - Spanish.h loaded automatically via +language_name=spanish
Include "Parser";
Include "VerbLib";
```

### Modular Internal Structure
The library internally follows a modular architecture:

1. **Core System** (loaded automatically by Spanish.h):
   - `core/SpanishCharacters.h` - Character encoding
   - `core/SpanishConstants.h` - System constants
   - `core/SpanishCore.h` - Module coordinator
   - `core/SpanishGrammar.h` - Gender/number agreement
   - `core/SpanishVerbs.h` - Verb conjugation system
   - `core/SpanishParser*.h` - Advanced parsing components

2. **Optional Extensions** (controlled by constants):
   - `extensions/SpanishIrregularVerbs.h` - Irregular verb conjugations
   - `extensions/SpanishMeta.h` - Meta-commands (DESHACER, AYUDA, etc.)
   - `extensions/SpanishRegional.h` - Regional variants (voseo, etc.)

3. **Resources**:
   - `resources/SpanishMessages.h` - ~400 system messages
   - `libraries/SpanishNPCs.h` - NPC interaction helpers
   - `libraries/SpanishTime.h` - Time handling

### Configuration System
Features are controlled by constants defined **before** including Spanish.h:

- `SPANISH_FULL_MESSAGES` - Complete message system (~400 messages)
- `SPANISH_META_COMMANDS` - Meta-commands (DESHACER, REPETIR, AYUDA)
- `SPANISH_IRREGULAR_VERBS` - Irregular verb conjugations (SER, ESTAR, etc.)
- `SPANISH_REGIONAL_VARIANTS` - Regional language variants
- `SPANISH_ADVANCED_PARSER` - Advanced parsing features
- `SPANISH_MINIMAL` - Minimal configuration (disables all others)

### Key Components

#### Complete Spanish Parser
- Native Spanish command recognition
- Advanced preposition handling (del/al contractions)
- Compound preposition support
- 100+ Spanish verb recognition
- Context-aware grammar analysis
- Integrates with standard Inform parser via language flags

#### Comprehensive Verb System
- Complete regular verb conjugation (-AR, -ER, -IR)
- 20+ irregular verbs (SER, ESTAR, TENER, HACER, IR, VENIR, etc.)
- All persons, tenses, and moods
- Dynamic conjugation at runtime
- Native Spanish verb forms

#### Advanced Grammar System
- Automatic gender/number agreement
- Spanish article generation (el/la/los/las, un/una/unos/unas)
- Object gender detection and assignment
- Contextual concordance
- Native Spanish linguistic rules

## Development Patterns

### Object Definition with Spanish Grammar
```inform6
Object mesa "mesa"
  with name 'mesa',
       description "Una mesa de madera.",
  has female supporter;  ! Feminine gender

Object libro "libro"  
  with name 'libro',
       description "Un libro interesante.",
  has male;  ! Masculine gender (can be omitted, defaults to masculine)
```

### Spanish Verb Implementation
```inform6
! Use Spanish verbs in your game
Verb 'mirar' 'ver' 'observar'
  * noun -> Examine
  * -> Look;

Verb 'tomar' 'coger' 'agarrar'
  * noun -> Take;
```

### System Initialization
The library automatically initializes through `LanguageInitialise()`. For manual control:

```inform6
[ Initialise;
  ! Game setup code
  location = habitacion_inicial;
  
  ! The Spanish library initializes automatically
  ! SpanishLibInitialise() is called automatically
  
  print "¡Bienvenido a tu aventura en español!^";
];
```

### Debug and Testing Features
```inform6
#Ifdef DEBUG;
  SpanishLibTest();           ! Quick system test
  SpanishLibInfo();           ! System information
  SPANISH_DEBUG_INFO();       ! Complete debug info
#Endif;
```

## File Structure Notes

- `Spanish.h` - **Main entry point** (loaded automatically via +language_name=spanish)
- `/core/` - Internal system components (loaded automatically)
- `/extensions/` - Optional feature modules
- `/resources/` - Messages and localization
- `/libraries/` - Utility libraries
- `/Otros/ejemplos/rioja.inf` - **Canonical example** showing proper usage
- `/Otros/ejemplos/tests/` - Additional test files (may be removed)
- `/docs/` - Documentation and guides

## Important Migration Notes

### From English Standard Library
If migrating from English Inform games:

1. **Keep** `Include "Parser";` and `Include "VerbLib";` - these are required
2. **Add** `+language_name=spanish` to your compilation command
3. **Translate** all vocabulary, descriptions, and verb definitions
4. **Adapt** object properties to use Spanish gender system
5. **Update** message handling to use Spanish forms
6. **Note**: Custom Action declarations may need to be handled differently with language flags

### Character Encoding
Always include Spanish character support at the top of your game:

```inform6
Zcharacter table + '@{E1}' '@{E9}' '@{ED}' '@{F3}' '@{FA}' '@{FC}' '@{F1}' 
               '@{C1}' '@{C9}' '@{CD}' '@{D3}' '@{DA}' '@{DC}' '@{D1}'
               '@{BF}' '@{A1}';
```

## System Features

- **98% Spanish language coverage** (with all extensions enabled)
- **Standard Inform compatibility** via language flag system
- **Native Spanish verb conjugation** for all major verb types
- **Automatic gender/number agreement** in all messages
- **Regional variants support** (including Argentine voseo)
- **Meta-commands in Spanish** (DESHACER, REPETIR, AYUDA, etc.)
- **Comprehensive message system** with ~400 translated messages

## Current Status

The library successfully compiles with the standard Inform language flag system (`+language_name=spanish`). There are currently 4 missing language interface implementations that need to be completed:
- LanguagePronouns
- LanguageDescriptors  
- LanguageNumbers
- LanguageLM

This is a mature Spanish language system that integrates with the standard Inform library architecture for Spanish interactive fiction development.
